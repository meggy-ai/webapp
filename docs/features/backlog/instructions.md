All the details about project overview is in project_overview.md.

1.0 You need to create a plan first with parent tasks and children tasks
with details from project-overview,first create a small set of feature to complete in first iteration
create a requirement-overview.md which has this small set of feature for first iteration,
next create a plan for implementation of this requirement,
we need to restructure entire app into frontend and backend as per the details captured in project-overview.md.
also make sure you cover all the core and foundation taken care of in the first iteration itself,
from next iteration we will try to plan to add functionality as a new feature in subsequent iterations
ask me if you have any questions
2.0 Create a progress tracker in the plan so that we will keep track of the
implementation phase by phase, in case you will doing a particular task
we will know where we left off and what to do next
3.0 After creating plan we will start implementation one by one
4.0 create an md file for the plan
